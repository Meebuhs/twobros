# Twobros Flutter Chat

This is a fork of the cross-platform demo chat client developed using Flutter & Firebase for a Toptal Engineering Blog article.
The article can be found [here](https://www.toptal.com/flutter/flutter-tutorial).

This fork enabled my first exploration of flutter and firebase and removes the google and facebook authentication and replaces them with a username and password signup/signin.

I was also hoping to make use of the web features now available in the beta release of flutter, however firebase_messaging does not yet support web.
As can be seen [here](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire).

Building an ipa from this fork has not been tested.
